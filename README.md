## Install
The latest codes are tested on Ubuntu 16.04, CUDA10.1, PyTorch 1.6 and Python 3.7:
```shell
conda install pytorch==1.6.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
```

## Introduction
* First, you should provide the data source "casex.def" and "fs_x.spef". Through these two types of files, you should change your files into "xxx.txt" format.
* Second, use "data/main.py" to produce dataset. The program will delete all files which has more than 256 columns.
* Third, use "cap_train.py" to train and test, all the results, including train loss and total MSE, will be stored in "result.txt"
* Fourth, the overfitting problem needs attention, you can change the total epoches in "cap_train.py".
* Last, you can examine the result in "result.txt", and the MSE of test can reach 1.653 in the best case.
